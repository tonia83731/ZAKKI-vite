      "Here, Mimin, I want to tell you that Uha has been selling here every morning since 1973 and she is now around 80 years old, Uha's house is in Tanjung Tarogong area and she leaves the house at 5 in the morning to trade at Pengkolan from 6 to at 8 o'clock because when the shop opens automatically, ema is no longer allowed to trade in front. Actually, this lady used to be strong enough to cook all the merchandise she made herself, but now because she's not strong enough and she doesn't have the capital, she trades in other people's goods with a profit of 200 rupiah per fruit, which she sells, from rice cake, fried food, kneading , cilok, bacil, gehu, bala bala, sticky rice, etc. So ema can only get 15-25 thousand per day and even then it is dirty, so profit for ema is only 5 thousand. If you pass by Pengkolan, maybe you will see that the fried stalls around UHA sell well because they use beautiful tables and trays, but UHA only uses nyiru, aka cross-legged on the sidewalk, so it doesn't attract enough buyers. But after Mimin talked at length with Mama's current situation but was still selling far away, Mama Uha just said 'Mama Mah, it's better to trade than having to ask other people' (Mama is better off selling than having to ask other people) ",
